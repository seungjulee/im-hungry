# Warning!!
This project no longer works. Yelp noticed the crawling server and blocked it. It was built over one weekend, and didn't have time to go through thorough test.

## For Development (OSX)
```bash
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
```

## For Production (Ubuntu 14.04 Dockerfile)
```bash
1. npm install

```

## TODO:
- Add script to handle logs for production
- Add tests
